You implemented the basic platform, but we need to tighten product logic and enforce real workflows. Apply the changes below across backend + frontend + database.

0) Development Reset

Completely reset the development database (wipe all tables / records).

Reseed the admin user:

username/email: admin

password: 123

role: admin

password MUST be hashed

Ensure password hashes are never returned in any API response.

1) Upload Wizard — MP3 + Cover are REQUIRED (Hard Rule)

Currently MP3 and cover upload are not required. Fix that.

Required assets

At least 1 audio file per track (accept .mp3 and/or .wav, but MP3 must be allowed)

Release must have a cover image (jpg/png)

Prevent submit until:

cover uploaded

minimum 1 track exists

each track has audio attached

Validation rules

Release Info required: title, primary artist, release type, genre, language, release date

Track required: track title, audio file, explicit flag default false

Distribution required: at least 1 DSP selected

Show user-friendly errors and block step navigation until valid.

2) DSP Selection — Provide 60 Popular DSPs

In the Distribution step:

Provide a list of the most well-known ~60 DSPs as selectable checkboxes with search/filter and “Select All”.

Store selected DSPs for each release.

Use a seeded DSP table (id, name, region, enabled=true).

Admin can enable/disable DSPs globally (so DSP list is manageable).

Implement DSP list as a database table and seed it on reset.

3) Admin = Full Control (Everything Editable)

Admin must be able to:

Edit ANY release data (title, artist, tracks, DSP selections, release date, cover, audio)

Approve / reject releases (rejection requires reason)

Edit ANY user info, assign role, deactivate/delete users

Change any user password (force reset) including admin password

View all applications, releases, payout requests

Change platform settings (minimum payout threshold, allowed payout methods, etc.)

Add admin-only screens and actions with role guards on both frontend & backend.

4) Approval Workflows — Separate Queues (Admin Pages)

Admin should have separate pages, not mixed:

Admin routes

/app/admin/applications

List pending account applications

Approve / reject + notes

/app/admin/releases

List pending releases

Approve / reject + reason

Admin can open and edit the release before approving

/app/admin/payouts

List payout requests

Approve / reject + reason

If approved → create payout transaction record

Keep these three queues separate and clearly labeled.

5) Account Applications — Must Gate Dashboard

New users are “applicants” until approved:

On register: create Application record + user in “pending approval” state (or user not created until approved—choose one consistent approach).

A non-approved user:

can log in (optional) but must ONLY see a “Waiting for admin approval” screen

cannot access /app/* dashboard pages

Approval flips isApproved=true (or converts applicant to user).

6) Payouts — Minimum $50 + Only Crypto/Bank + Method Approval
Payout rules

Minimum withdrawal amount: $50 (hard rule)

Only payout methods allowed for now:

Crypto

Bank Transfer

User must submit a Payout Method Application (like account application) that goes to admin.

Admin approves/rejects payout method before payouts can be requested.

User payout flow

Payout page shows:

Available balance

Minimum threshold reminder ($50)

Payment method status (Pending/Approved/Rejected)

Withdraw form disabled until method approved + available balance >= 50

Admin payout flow

Admin reviews payout requests in /app/admin/payouts

Admin approve → mark payout as “approved” and create a transaction record

Admin reject → require reason

7) Support Tickets — Must Exist & Work

Support is not complete. Implement:

User can create ticket: subject required, message required

Ticket thread with messages

Status: open / in_progress / closed

Admin can reply and change status
Routes:

/app/support user side

/app/admin/support admin side (optional but recommended)

8) Security & Route Guards

Backend must check role/approval status on every protected endpoint.

Frontend route guard:

Not logged in → /login

Logged in but not approved → /pending-approval (only logout allowed)

Approved user → /app/*

Admin-only routes blocked unless role=admin

Strip password hashes from any responses.

Add server-side validation for all required fields (never rely only on frontend).

9) Data Models (Minimum)

Implement/adjust schemas:

User: id, username/email, passwordHash, role, isApproved, createdAt

Application: id, userId or applicant data, status, notes, createdAt

DSP: id, name, enabled

Release: id, title, artistId, coverUrl, releaseDate, status, rejectionReason, createdByUserId

Track: id, releaseId, title, audioUrl, explicit

ReleaseDSP: releaseId, dspId

PayoutMethodApplication: id, userId, type(crypto/bank), details, status, createdAt

PayoutRequest: id, userId, amount, methodId, status, rejectionReason, createdAt

Earnings/Balance: keep mock but consistent (availableBalance must be calculable or seeded)

Ticket + TicketMessage

10) UI Changes

Ensure public site never shows portal/dashboard components.

Dashboard should feel premium SaaS:

Sidebar + topbar + pages

Tables, filters, status pills

Catalog: show releases with status, streams, revenue (mock ok).

Upload: strict validation + required MP3/cover.

Payouts: enforce $50 minimum and method approval.

11) Final: Provide a test checklist

At the end, output a checklist to test:

admin login admin/123

register new user → pending approval

admin approves user → user gets dashboard access

user submits release without cover/audio → blocked

user submits valid release → pending

admin edits and approves/rejects release

user tries payout under $50 → blocked

user submits payout method → admin approves

user requests payout >= $50 → admin approves/rejects

user creates support ticket → admin replies

Do not leave placeholders. Implement real logic with minimum viable UI and consistent data flow.
